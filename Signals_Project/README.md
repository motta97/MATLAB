# Introduction
Signal processing is a fundamental aspect of modern engineering, with applications spanning various fields such as telecommunications, audio engineering,
biomedical signal analysis, and more. This project, undertaken as part of the course Signals and Systems Fundamentals, aims to deepen our understanding of key concepts by 
applying them to a real-world scenario: the analysis and processing of audio signals.
The primary goal of this project is to develop a MATLAB-based code that performs comprehensive analysis and filtering of an audio signal.
Through this activity, we aim to reinforce the theoretical concepts covered in the course, such as time-domain and frequency-domain representations,
energy calculations, and system responses to filtering.
# Methodology

As a team, we wanted to divide the project into smaller tasks that each of us could do, so the whole project was done in the end. We divided the project into those specific tasks:
Making the audio file of us mentioning our name
Plotting the audio signal in the time domain
Calculating the signal energy from the time domain
Finding the frequency domain representation of the signal and plotting it
Calculating the signal energy from the frequency domain
Comparing it with the calculated value in the time domain
Applying a Butterworth filter of 10th order to change the original frequency components of the audio signal and plotting the filtered signal in the frequency domain
Finding the corresponding signal in the time domain for the filtered signal and plotting it.
Saving the filtered audio file in time domain on the hard disk
Collecting the distributed code in only one file
Verifying its functionality
# Conclusion
In contrast, by analyzing and processing an audio signal, we gained valuable insights into the key concepts of time-domain and frequency-domain representations,
signal energy calculations, and the application of filtering techniques. This project not only reinforced our theoretical understanding of signal processing but also 
enhanced our practical programming skills and our ability to work collaboratively in a team. By breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks, we were able to
apply learned concepts effectively and gain experience with real-world signal processing challenges.
