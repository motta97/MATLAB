# MATLAB codes
I leave here all the MATLAB code that I developed and it successfully do its task
Some of those codes are associated with the course "Introduction to Programming with MATLAB" from Vanderbily University,
some are from projects asscoiated with my degree, and some others I just developed for personal use.
Have Fun!
